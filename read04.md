# JavaScript.
### 1- Functions, Methods, and Objects (pp.86-99).

#### Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. 
* FUNCTIONS & METHODS
* OBJECTS
* BUILT-IN OBJECT

##### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task if you have a thing repeated all the time during the code.
### declare a function.
```
var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!'; 
function updateMessage() { 
var el = document.getElementByld('message'}; 
el .textContent = msg; 
} 
```
### calling function :
`updateMessage();`

#### declare function with parameters.
#### declare function with return value so you can assign it to  variables.

#### ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS.

  - An anonymous function is a function without a name. An anonymous function is often not accessible after its initial creation

  - A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression.

  ` var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};`


# Pair Programming.

pair programming is where two developers work using only one machine. Each one has a keyboard and a mouse. One programmer acts as the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next. 

### Pair Programming Advantages
  - Two heads are better than one
  - More efficient.
  - Fewer coding mistakes.
  - An effective way to share knowledge.
  - Develops your staffâ€™s interpersonal skills.
