# CSS Transitions
- CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

 Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect:

- CSS

`transition`

`transition-delay`

`transition-duration`

`transition-property`

`transition-timing-function`
## How to Use CSS Transitions?
- To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

  - the CSS property you want to add an effect to the duration of the effect.

### Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition
- The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

- The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

`ease` - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)

`linear` - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end

`ease-in` - specifies a transition effect with a slow start

`ease-out` - specifies a transition effect with a slow end

`ease-in-out` - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end

`cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)` - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

# CSS Animations
CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

CSS

- @keyframes
- animation-name
- animation-duration
- animation-delay
- animation-iteration-count
- animation-direction
- animation-timing-function
- animation-fill-mode
- animation

## What are CSS Animations?
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.

To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
